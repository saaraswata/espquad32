# ESP32-Quadcopter


### Introduction

**ESP32-Quadcopter** is an open source solution based on Espressif ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-S3 Wi-Fi chip, which can be controlled by a mobile APP or gamepad over **Wi-Fi** connection. ESP-Drone comes with **simple hardware**, **clear and extensible code architecture**, and therefore this project can be used in **STEM education** and other fields. The main code is ported from **Crazyflie** open source project with **GPL3.0** protocol.
