* [中文](./README_cn.md)

### Introduction

**ESP-Drone** is an open source solution based on Espressif ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-S3 Wi-Fi chip, which can be controlled by a mobile APP or gamepad over **Wi-Fi** connection. ESP-Drone comes with **simple hardware**, **clear and extensible code architecture**, and therefore this project can be used in **STEAM education** and other fields. The main code is ported from **Crazyflie** open source project with **GPL3.0** protocol.

> Currently support ESP32、ESP32S2、ESP32S3, please using ESP-IDF [release/v4.4](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.4/esp32s2/get-started/index.html) branch as your develop environment
